********************************** Pascal-P4 archives **************************

These files contain the entire source and binaries for the project Pascal-P4.

The current (latest) version is always named:

pascal-P4.tar.gz

When a new version is created, it will always be copied to the same file with
the date of its creation, like:

pascal-P4_20151219.tar.gz

The date is in major to minor format. The above is year 2015, month 12 (Dec),
day 19 (this format makes the files sort correctly).

Pascal-P4 does not have version numbers. It is simply referenced by the date
it was archived. Since Pascal-P4 is no longer under development, it does not
need a version number.

Please note that all fixes and improvements to Pascal-P4 go into Pascal-P5,
a newer project. This project is essentially here as a historical reference.

*** Installing ***

To unpack the archive, go to the directory where you want to place it,
and execute:

tar -xzf pascal-p4.tar.gz
